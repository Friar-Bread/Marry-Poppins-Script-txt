[MICHAEL] I can't do my lessons if I'm flying a kite!
[JANE] And you can't make us. You're only our nanny.
[STAGE] (The CHILDREN stamp on KATIE NANNA's foot and succeed in losing her, Their freedom is short-lived as they run straight into the local POLICEMAN.)

[HEADER] SCENE 2: MARY'S ARRIVAL -Parlor
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS appears among them. She is wearing a hat with cherries in the
[STAGE] brim and carrying an umbrella with a handle shaped like a parrot's head.)
[MARY POPPINS] Good morning .
[STAGE] (approaching MARY POPPINS)
[MARY POPPINS] Yes? GEORGE
[MARY POPPINS] I've corne in answer to the advertisement.
[GEORGE] What advertisement? We haven't placed any advertisement. Not yet.
[MARY POPPINS] George and Winifred Banks live here, do they not?
[GEORGE] Mr. and Mrs. Banks live here, yes.
[MARY POPPINS] And you are looking for a nanny?
[GEORGE] Well, I suppose-
[MARY POPPINS] Very well then. Now, let's see.
[STAGE] (From her pocket, MARY POPPINS takes a torn but now mended piece of paper)
[MARY POPPINS] "Play games, all sorts." Which I most certainly can. "Take us on outings, give us
[MARY POPPINS] treats,"
[MARY POPPINS] (GEORGE casts an uneasy look towards the CHILDREN. This sounds very like ... but
[MARY POPPINS] it can't be! He stares at MARY POPPINS blankly. JANE and MICHAEL listen from
[MARY POPPINS] the staircase.)
[JANE] Michael! It's our advertisement!
[MARY POPPINS] "Rosy cheeks and fairly pretty."
[STAGE] (to GEORGE)
[MARY POPPINS] There's no objection on that score, I hope?
[STAGE] (blushing)
[MARY POPPINS] Oh, none at all.
[MARY POPPINS] I'm glad to hear it. MARY POPPINS
[MARY POPPINS] (MARY POPPINS stares at him so firmly that, for a moment, it is like a ray of light
[MARY POPPINS] passing right through him.)
[GEORGE] But-oh, take it up with Mrs. Banks. She manages all that side of things. Nothing
[GEORGE] domestic has anything to do with me! And don't forget the references!
[GEORGE] (GEORGE is gone, leaving WINIFRED and the newcomer staring at each other. After
[GEORGE] a moment, MARY POPPINS speaks.)
[MARY POPPINS] I make it a rule never to give references.
[WINIFRED] But I thought it was usual.
[MARY POPPINS] A very old-fashioned idea to my mind. The best people never require them now.
[WINIFRED] I see. You will have every third Thursday evening off from five until nine.
[MARY POPPINS] The best people give every second Wednesday from six' til late, rna' am, and that is
[MARY POPPINS] what I shall take.
[WINIFRED] Oh, I see ... well... it's all settled then ...
[MARY POPPINS] As long as I am satisfied. I'll see the children now, thank you.
[WINIFRED] Of course ...
[STAGE] (turns back nervously)
[WINIFRED] You'll find they're very nice children ...
[WINIFRED] (JANE and MICHAEL come screaming down the stairs and stand in front of MARY
[POPPINS.)] N ow this is ... oh. -11 -
[-12 - MARY POPPINS] (WINIFRED is surprised to find that she has employed someone without knowing her
[-12 - MARY POPPINS] name.)
[MARY POPPINS] Mary Poppins.
[MARY POPPINS] (For a moment, MARY POPPINS looks at the CHILDREN as if she were reading their
[MARY POPPINS] souls. They stare back.)
[MARY POPPINS] Jane, don't stare. And close your mouth, Michael. We are not a codfish.
[MARY POPPINS] (But MICHAEL is not so easily conquered as he continues looking at MARY
[MARY POPPINS] POPPINS. She gives a sharp nod and starts up the stairs.)
[MARY POPPINS] Best foot forward. Spit-spot.
[SONG] #4A -Spit-Spot orchestr<l
[STAGE] (MICHAEL and JANE run up the stairs in front of MARY POPPINS as the relieved
[STAGE] WINIFRED watches. MRS. BRILL has joined her.)
[WINIFRED] Mrs. Brill, we have a new nanny.
[MRS. BRILL] She passed her interview, then?
[WINIFRED] Or I did.
[STAGE] (WINIFRED and MRS. BRILL exit.)
[HEADER] SCENE 3: PRACTICALLY PERFECT -Nursery
[STAGE] (The nursery is an airy room, light and full of optimism. The CHILDREN rush in to
[STAGE] find that MARY POPPINS is already there.)
[MARY POPPINS] Very tidy, I must say. Tidier than I was expecting. Who's responsible for that?
[JANE] Mrs. Bri-
[MICHAEL] Me. I am. I like to keep things neat.
[MARY POPPINS] Do you indeed? Well, I look forward to making use of that. If there's one thing I
[MARY POPPINS] appreciate, it's a child whose word I can depend on.
[STAGE] (scoops up a boy doll)
[MARY POPPINS] Who's he when he's at home?
[JANE] That's Valentine. He's mine.
[MARY POPPINS] From the look on his face, I'm not sure he'd agree with you.
[JANE] He's just a doll and I don't want to play with him now.
[STAGE] (JANE throws the doll into a box.)
[MARY POPPINS] Treat him like that and he might not want to play with you. Now, first things first.
[MARY POPPINS] I always say the proper place to hang a hat is on a hat stand. -13 -
[MARY POPPINS] (MARY POPPINS reaches in her bag and takes out a hat stand. JANE and MICHAEL
[MARY POPPINS] look inside as they move the bag.)
[JANE] There's nothing in it!
[MICHAEL] We'd better keep an eye on this one. She's tricky.
[JANE] Mary POp pins, how could you know what we wanted in a narmy ... when we made
[JANE] our list?
[MARY POPPINS] Your "list"? I'm not an item in the weekly shop, thank you very much.
[SONG] #4C -Mllg;c M 1I~;( 2 orchestra
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS takes another item, perhaps a plant, out of her bag and places it
[STAGE] strategically in the nursery.)
[JANE] How did you come then? It was as if the wind just blew you here.
[MARY POPPINS] It did. Now, stand over there!
[MARY POPPINS] (MAR Y POPPINS pulls a measuring tape from the bag, holds it against MICHAEL,
[MARY POPPINS] and reads the measure.)
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS)
[MARY POPPINS] Just as I thought. "A noisy, mischievous, troublesome little boy."
[MICHAEL] You're making that up!
[STAGE] (Without a word, MARY POPPINS holds the tape for MiCHAEL to read.)
[MICHAEL] /I A noisy, mischievous, troub -/I
[STAGE] (Stunned, MICHAEL looks at JANE.)
[MARY POPPINS] Now you.
[STAGE] (holds the tape against JANE and reads)
[MARY POPPINS] "Thoughtless, short-tempered and untidy./I
[JANE] I don't believe you. Let me see-
[~] [MARY POPPINS] BY THE TIME THE WIND HAS BLOWN
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS)

[~] [MARY POPPINS] FOR ONE THING I'M RENOWNED:
[~] [MARY POPPINS] MY CHARACTER IS SPIT-SPOT SPIC AND SPAN.
[JANE] What about your measurement, Mary Poppins?

[~] [SO PEOPLE SAY.] I'M SO PRACTICALLY PERFECT IN EVERY WAY.

[SO PEOPLE SAY.] herself as she puts on an apron.)
[SO PEOPLE SAY.] Ab ... lovely!

[SO PEOPLE SAY.] Never. MARY POPPINS
[MARY POPPINS] The very thought.
[~] [WILL YOU STAY TENDER] WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH?
[MARY POPPINS] Quite the contrary.
[MARY POPPINS] Mm-hmm. MICHAEL
[~] [OR HAVE OBJECTIONS] TO PLAYING WITH US? JANE
[MARY POPPINS] Oh, I like games. But I choose them.
[STAGE] (protesting, variously:)
[MARY POPPINS] But -That's not fair! JANE, MICHAEL
[~] [MARY POPPINS] SOME MINOR IMPROVEMENTS MAY NOT GO AMISS,
[~] [MARY POPPINS] BUT AT ALL TIMES YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS ...

[EACH TRAIT IS GREAT] telescope.)
[PATENTLY SOUND .] Spit-spot. Jane ... doll's house please.
[PATENTLY SOUND .] (The CHILDREN put a doll's house on a table. MICHAEL has picked up the
[PATENTLY SOUND .] telescope.)
[PATENTLY SOUND .] I'll take my telescope, thank you.
[MICHAEL] It's not fair!
[MARY POPPINS] I didn't say I was fair. I said I was ...

[HEADER] SCENE 4: JOLLY HOLIDAY -Park
[SONG] #5A -All Me Q'WJI Work Bert
[STAGE] (Park gates reveal the park beyond. BERT paints the scene as he addresses the
[STAGE] audience.)
[~] [BERT] CHIM CHIMINEY, CHIM CHIMINEY, CHIM CHIM CHER-OO.
[~] [BERT] I DOES WHAT I LIKES AND I LIKES WHAT I DO.

[~] [BERT] A SCREEVER'S AN ARTIST OF HIGHEST DEGREE .
[~] [BERT] AND ITS ALL ME OWN WORK
[STAGE] (A furious PARK KEEPER hurries towards BERT.)
[PARK KEEPER] Oh, Lununy. Not these again!
[BERT] Come on, Mr. Park Keeper. It's just me pictures like it always is. There's no 'arm in
[BERT] 'em.
[PARK KEEPER] I'll be the judge 0' that! This is my park and I say you're interfering with a public
[PARK KEEPER] railing! I want' em removed this-
[PARK KEEPER] (The PARK KEEPER trails offas he becomes aware of MARY POPPINS, who is with
[PARK KEEPER] the CHILDREN. She looks firmly at him. BERT continues to draw without lifting his
[PARK KEEPER] eyes.)
[PARK KEEPER] That is-1-er... just you watch it. That's alL just you watch it!
[STAGE] (The PARK KEEPER walks off muttering . BERT speaks, still without raising his eyes.)
[BERT] Stay right where you are. 1'd know that silhouette anywhere: Mary Poppins!
[MARY POPPINS] It's nice to see you, Bert.
[STAGE] (BERT turns his eyes from his drawing and looks up.)
[BERT] Well, I must say you do look swelL
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS snorts, but as she pats her hair, it is clear she agrees.)
[MICHAEL] How does he know you? He can't know you! You've only just arrived!
[MARY POPPINS] I wasn't born one minute before I walked into your house, Michael Banks . Have you
[MARY POPPINS] met these two, Bert?
[BERT] I've seen 'ern runnin' about chasin' a kite.
[MICHAEL] It isn't a real kite.
[BERT] So, what are you up to?
[JANE] Mary Poppins says it's a game. It's called "A Walk in the Park."
[MICHAEL] Some game.
[STAGE] (kicks the pavement)
[MICHAEL] 1'd rather eat spinach.
[MARY POPPINS] Corne on, Bert. You're due for a break, and you promised you'd take me out when
[MARY POPPINS] we met again. Or have you forgotten?
[BERT] 'Course I ain't, Mary. But...
[STAGE] (BERT picks up his cap. There's only one coin in it.)
[MARY POPPINS] Oh dear, is that all you've got? Never mind. My treat. And no one's charging for
[MARY POPPINS] the trees and the sky, are they?
[JANE] Mary Poppins, is he really coming with us?
[MARY POPPINS] Why shouldn't he?
[JANE] Well, to start with, he's very dirty, isn't he? Father would never approve.
[BERT] What's that?
[STAGE] (berates BERT)
[MICHAEL] You can't come with us. You're too dirty. And we don't want to go to the stinky
[MICHAEL] park anyway.
[STAGE] (gives it right back to MICHAEL)
[BERT] Oh, yes you do. 'Cause when you walk with Mary Pop pins, you go to places you
[BERT] never dreamed of. And if she says it's a game, she's got something in mind. You
[BERT] can be certain of that.
[STAGE] (BERT and the CHILDREN stand by his line of paintings.)
[JANE] That's a picture of the park, isn't it?
[MICHAEL] That's not the park. Not our park anyway. Look, that tree's a much brighter green
[MICHAEL] and the sky's quite a different blue ...
[BERT] I think you'll find it's just the way I've drawn it.

[STAGE] (to the CHILDREN)
[BERT] Come on, you two.
[BERT] (BERT and MARY POPPINS exit. JANE and MICHAEL lag behind until they are
[BERT] alone near a statue of a boy with a dolphin on a plinth.)
[~] [JANE, MICHAEL] BORING, JUST LIKE OTHER NANNIES
[~] [JANE, MICHAEL] THINKING PARKS ARE GOOD FOR US.
[~] [JANE, MICHAEL] IT'S JUST STATUES, DUCKS AND GRANNIES.
[~] [JANE, MICHAEL] I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE FUSS.
[~] [JANE] IS SHE DOING IT TO SPITE US?
[~] [MICHAEL] WE COULD LOSE HER FOR A LARK.
[~] [JANE] PERHAPS IT'S ALL A PLOT.
[~] [JANE, MICHAEL] BUT I BET SHE'S NOT. -21 -
[STAGE] (JANE, MICHAEL)
[~] [-22 - MARY POPPINS] THERE IS NOTHING TO EXCITE US
[STAGE] (A creaking sound.)
[STAGE] (Another creak.)
[STAGE] (The creaking grows louder and more confident.)
[JANE] What was that?
[NELEUS] You're quite wrong, you know.
[NELEUS] (JANE and MICHAEL look up. The statue of the boy, NELEUS, is apparently smiling
[NELEUS] at them. They are terrified.)
[MICHAEL] Wha-who are you ... ?
[NELEUS] I'm Neleus. Surely you know that. You've sat beneath me often enough. I've
[NELEUS] waited half a century to take a walk on a sunny day like this!
[NELEUS] (MARY POPPINS appears with BERT, both of them sporting bright summer clothes.
[NELEUS] As BERT sings, the park is transformed: the grass and trees become the richest green
[NELEUS] imaginable, the sky the richest blue, the sun the brightest yellow. A series of bizarre
[NELEUS] events take place. MARY POPPINS weaves among the PARK STROLLERS, and the
[NELEUS] CHILDREN make the discovery that things are not as they seem. ALL watch the
[NELEUS] transformations from dull and gray to bright and colorful.)
[~] [BERT] AIN'T IT A GLORIOUS DAY,
[~] [BERT] RIGHT AS A MORNIN' IN MAY.
[~] [NEL.EUS] I FEEL LIKE I COULD FLY.
[~] [MARY POPPINS] HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE GRASS SO GREEN?
[~] [BERT,NELEUS] OH, IT'S A JOLLY HOLIDAY WITH MARY.
[~] [BERT] BETTER DAYS I'VE NEVER KNOWN.

[~] [MARY POPPINS] MARY POPPINS, BERT, NELEUS, PARK STROLLERS
[~] [MARY POPPINS] NOTHING'S EVER SET IN STONE!
[STAGE] (The POLICEMAN is instantly transformed into a colorful uniform.)
[POLICEMAN] 'Morning, Mary!
[MARY POPPINS] 'Mornin~ Constable.
[BERT] You do look tip-top if I may say so.
[MARY POPPINS] Thank you, Bert. And you may.
[~] [BERT] EACH MAN OUT WITH HIS DOG

[~] [BERT, NELEUS, MEN] OH, IT'S A JOLLY HOLIDAY WITH MARY.
[~] [BERT] NO WONDER THAT IT'S MARY THAT WE LOVE.
[BERT] (MARY POPPINS interrupts the praise as she and BERT have a moment to dance
[BERT] together.)
[~] [MARY POPPINS] IT'S A JOLLY HOLIDAY WITH YOU, BERT.
[~] [MARY POPPINS] GENTLEMEN LIKE YOU ARE FEW.
[~] [MARY POPPINS] THOUGH YOU'RE JUST A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH, BERT,
[~] [MARY POPPINS] UNDERNEATH YOUR BLOOD IS BLUE. -23 -
[~] [MARY POPPINS] YOU'D NEVER THINK OF PRESSING YOUR ADVANTAGE.
[~] [MARY POPPINS] FORBEARANCE IS THE HALLMARK OF YOUR CREED.
[~] [MARY POPPINS] A LADY NEEDN'T FEAR WHEN YOU ARE NEAR.
[~] [MARY POPPINS] YOUR SWEET GENTILITY IS CRYSTAL-CLEAR.
[~] [MARY POPPINS, WOMEN] OH, IT'S A JOLLY HOLIDAY WITH YOU, BERT.
[~] [ALL] A JOLLY, JOLLY HOLIDAY WITH YOU!
[ALL] (During an instrumental dance section, STATUES come alive. BERT and MARY
[ALL] POPPINS sit at a tea party and are then joined by NELEUS and the CHILDREN.
[ALL] After a bit, BERT leaves the party to examine the STATUES, which soon begin to chase
[ALL] him.)
[BERT] Mary. Eh, Mary ...
[MARY POPPINS] You've only got yourself to blame, Bert.
[~] [BERT, MEN] LET'S GO FOR A JAUNTY SAUNTER.
[~] [BERT, MEN] WE ARE BOUND TO MAKE A MARK.

[BERT, MEN] comes into view.)

[SONG] #6A -H{(t HU1(' orchestr,1
[STAGE] (A rainstonn breaks. The STATUES and TRANSFORMED CHARACTERS
[STAGE] disappear as the color drains from the scene. The dazed CHILDREN are left standing
[STAGE] in front of NELEUS, who is back on his plinth.)
[MICHAEL] Jane. Did that really happen?
[JANE] Yes. But how?
[NELEUS] Mary Poppins, of course.
[STAGE] (The CHILDREN gasp -then it wasn't a dream!)
[NELEUS] How do you know Mary Poppins?
[STAGE] (approaches the CHILDREN)
[NELEUS] She's an old friend of my father. MICHAEL
[MICHAEL] Your father! You're a statue. You can't have a father!
[NELEUS] Well if that's true, why do I miss him so much?
[JANE] Isn't he one of the other statues?
[STAGE] (shakes his head sadly)
[NELEUS] No. He lives far away from here.
[JANE] Do you really miss him?
[NELEUS] Wouldn't you miss your father if you hardly ever saw him?
[MICHAEL] I'll have to think about that.
[STAGE] (The PARK KEEPER runs on, followed by BERT and MARY POPPINS.)
[PARK KEEPER] That's it! That's it! That's what it was!
[BERT] What?
[PARK KEEPER] This plinth is half empty. The statue's gone.
[STAGE] (Quick as a flash, BERT takes the PARK KEEPER's arm and spins him around.)
[MARY POPPINS] Do you mean you've lost your marbles?
[STAGE] (NELEUS vaults into place.)
[PARK KEEPER] This is your fault, ain't it? I knew we should have trouble when you first arrived!
[PARK KEEPER] Now we've got a statue missing.
[STAGE] (sees NELEUS on his plinth and starts back with a cry)
[PARK KEEPER] What? Oh, Lummy!
[STAGE] (The PARK KEEPER exits.)
[JANE] Will you play with us again?
[NELEUS] Of course I will. I'm not going anywhere.
[JANE] Then we'll see you soon.
[STAGE] (A small thunderclap.)
[JANE, MICHAEL] Goodbye, Neleus.
[NELEUS] Goodbye.
[SONG] #68 -/\ Hit of IIIlt7gillt1tioll orchestra
[STAGE] (There's a big clap of thunder and it starts to pour. The CHILDREN run through the
[STAGE] rain under MARY POPPINS's umbrella towards No. 17. As they reach the house, the
[STAGE] figure of a small wizened woman [the BIRD WOMAN] passes them by.)
[JANE] Neleus must be so lonely. Could his father ever corne to stay?
[MARY POPPINS] Anything can happen if you let it.
[JANE] How long will you stay?
[MARY POPPINS] We'll see.
[MICHAEL] You won't leave us, will you, Mary Pop pins?
[MARY POPPINS] I'll stay until the wind changes. Now run along in.
[BERT] Goodnight, Jane. Goodnight, Michael. Goodnight, Mary.
[MARY POPPINS] Goodnight, Bert.
[STAGE] (The CHILDREN and MARY POPPINS enter the house.)
[HEADER] SCENE 5: LET'S HOPE SHE WILL STAY -Parlor
[STAGE] (WINIFRED is at the study door. GEORGE is working at his desk. The CHILDREN
[STAGE] and MAR Y take off their outdoor clothes.)
[WINIFRED] Jane and Michael want to say goodnight.
[GEORGE] Tell them you've given me the message.
[WINIFRED] George, please ...
[STAGE] (GEORGE reluctantly comes out into the hall.)
[JANE] Oh, Daddy! We've had a fantastic day! We sang with a busker, danced with a
[JANE] statue, and met Queen Victoria! You wouldn't have approved but-
[GEORGE] If you know that, then why did you do it?
[MICHAEL] Daddy, could I have a kite? A proper one?
[GEORGE] Could you fly it?
[MICHAEL] You could always teach me.
[GEORGE] When would I have the time to do that?
[STAGE] (MICHAEL accepts this with a sad nod. He's used to it.)
[JANE] Daddy, who was the father of Neleus?
[GEORGE] Would you please let me get on! Goodnight!
[GEORGE] (As the children go out, GEORGE returns to the study and takes up his pen with a
[GEORGE] sigh.)
[WINIFRED] Poor Michael. All he cares about is flying kites, and his beloved astronomy of
[WINIFRED] course.
[GEORGE] I used to love astronomy at his age. My nanny, Miss Andrew, soon beat it out of me.
[WINIFRED] I suppose we do need a nanny George. It is out of the question to do without one?
[GEORGE] Don't be absurd! Of course we need a nanny! All the best people have nannies! So
[GEORGE] the wives can do charity work and entertain. Which reminds me, how is your tea
[GEORGE] party coming on?
[WINIFRED] I'm not sure. It seems so odd to send out invitations to people I hardly know.
[GEORGE] But they're people you should know. Remember : /lBy your friends shall ye be
[GEORGE] judged./I
[WINIFRED -29 -] But that's the point. They're not my friends ... Actually, I heard today from Clemmie
[WINIFRED -29 -] Bunting. She's rehearsing a new play at the moment and I thought I might ask her-
[GEORGE] How many times must I tell you? I wish you to sever all connection with that part
[GEORGE] of your life.
[WINIFRED] George, I was an actress. Lots of people might find that interesting ... though you
[WINIFRED] always talk as if I should be ashamed of it.
[GEORGE] Welt it's not exactly something to be proud of!
[STAGE] (GEORGE has hurt WINIFRED 's feelings, which was not his intention.)
[GEORGE] Winifred. Dearest. I'm only thinking of you. I want people to admire you, to
[GEORGE] respect you.
[WINIFRED] I know, George. But sometimes it's hard-
[GEORGE] It is not hard. It's your job, to be Mrs. Banks.
[WINIFRED] And what is your job?
[GEORGE] To pay for everything.
[STAGE] (GEORGE turns his attention to the desk again. WINIFRED leans in, startling him.)
[STAGE] (GEORGE)
[-30 - MARY POPPINS] What is it?
[WINIFRED] I was only going to kiss you.
[GEORGE] Oh ... Oh! All right.
[GEORGE] (GEORGE lifts his face for a rather unsatisfactory kiss. Sadly, WINIFRED starts for
[GEORGE] the door.)
[GEORGE] Are you going to say something to Mary Poppins about this afternoon?
[WINIFRED] I don't think so.
[GEORGE] Very well. But just make sure she's doing things our way and not hers.
[GEORGE] #i -Lct'~ HOJlc She Will Stay George, Winifred, Jane, Michael
[STAGE] (GEORGE)
[~] [GEORGE] WHAT GOOD ARE RULES IF YOU CAN BEND THEM?
[~] [GEORGE] WE NEED A NANNY WHO IS DISCIPLINED AND STERN.
[~] [GEORGE] WITH BOYS AND GIRLS, YOU DON'T BEFRIEND THEM.
[~] [GEORGE] I FEAR THAT MARY POPPINS HAS A LOT TO LEARN.
[GEORGE] (GEORGE turns back to his desk. WINIFRED leaves the study and goes to the parlor
[GEORGE] as she considers GEORGE 's remark.)
[~] [BEING MRS. BANKS] SHOULD BE AN EASY ROLE,
[~] [BEING MRS. BANKS] AND YET IT'S ONE WHICH I DON'T SEEM
[~] [BEING MRS. BANKS] TOO GOOD AT ON THE WHOLE.
[BEING MRS. BANKS] r HAVE A COMFY HOME.
[BEING MRS. BANKS] r HAVE A SIMPLE LIFE.
[~] [BEING MRS. BANKS] I HAVE A NAME WHICH TELLS THE WORLD
[~] [WHAT DOES THAT ENTAIL?] FACING TESTS OF CHARACTER I ALWAYS SEEM TO FAIL
[STAGE] (WINIFRED)
[~] [MARY POPPINS] AND AS FOR HIS "BEST PEOPLE,"
[~] [MARY POPPINS] WELL, I'D LIKE TO SAY "NO THANKS ."
[~] [MARY POPPINS] THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY MY IDEA OF BEING MRS. BANKS.
[STAGE] (JANE and MICHAEL appear and look out a window.)
[~] [JANE] I STILL FEEL AS IF I'M DREAMING.
[~] [MICHAEL] SO MUCH FUN IN JUST ONE DAY.
[~] [JANE, MICHAEL] WHEN MARY HOLDS YOUR HAND, YOU FEEL SO GRAND .
[~] [JANE, MICHAEL] YOUR HEART STARTS BEATING LIKE A BIG BRASS BAND.
[~] [JANE] I'M SURE NELEUS IS BEAMING.

[JANE] Goodnight , Neleus.
[~] [WINIFRED] LET'S HOPE SHE WILL STAY.

[SONG] #7A -Winds 00 CllI7JlXc Bert
[STAGE] (Some time has passed, perhaps a week or so. On the pavement outside No. 17, BERT
[STAGE] sweeps the gutter and addresses the audience.)
[~] [BERT] WINDS DO CHANGE, TIDES CAN TURN.
[~] [BERT] SINK OR SWIM, SEE WHAT YOU LEARN.
[~] [BERT] ME, I WAS TOLD WHEN I WAS SMALL,

[STAGE] (ADMIRAL BOOM and MISS LARK appear.)
[ADMIRAL BOOM] 'Morning, Bert. Swabbing the decks today, I see.
[BERT] Gotta keep the street ship-shape, Admiral!
[ADMIRAL BOOM] Tell me, how are things aboard No. I7? All plain sailing with Mary Poppins, I trust.
[BERT] There's some rough weather on every voyage, Admiral.
[BERT] (BERT resumes his sweeping, moving away from ADMIRAL BOOM and MISS
[STAGE] (shaking his head)
[ADMIRAL BOOM] Ah Miss Lark, what those children need is a touch of the cat and a night on the
[ADMIRAL BOOM] yardarm.
[MISS LARK] 'What those children need, Admiral, is a touch of happiness!
[MISS LARK] (This is a novel idea for ADMIRAL BOOM, as he watches MISS LARK walk on,
[MISS LARK] clutching WILLOUGHBY, who barks.)
[MISS LARK] Willoughby!
[MISS LARK] (In the kitchen, a nervous WINIFRED is with MRS. BRILL. All around are signs of
[MISS LARK] preparations for the tea. ROBERTSON AY watches.)
[WINIFRED] Mrs. Brill, don't make the sandwiches too early. They'll get stale before the guests
[WINIFRED] arrive.
[MRS. BRILL] Everything's under control, rna' am.
[WINIFRED] What about the cake?
[MRS. BRILL] Cooling on the tray, waiting to be iced.
[WINIFRED] And you're quite sure you know how to ice it?
[MRS. BRILL] Quite sure. And in case you're worried, I have not been exchanged by the fairies for
[MRS. BRILL] a total nincompoop!
[WINIFRED] No!
[ROBERTSON AY] No ...
[WINIFRED] Well. I'll just go up and check the drawing room.
[STAGE] (WINIFRED leaves MRS. BRILL fuming. ROBERTSON A Y pipes up.)
[ROBERTSON AY] I'd like to be helpfuL
[MRS. BRILL] I'd like to be rich. But the Good Lord thought otherwise.
[STAGE] (JANE and MICHAEL come through the door.)
[JANE] Mother wants you in the drawing room.
[MRS. BRILL] Well she can't have me. I've got enough on my plate as it is.
[JANE] She says you can tell Robertson Ay what to do.
[MRS. BRILL] Does she indeed? Well, why don't I go and have a smoke near the gasworks for
[MRS. BRILL] good measure? -33 -
[ROBERTSON AY] Please, Mrs. Brill. I don't mind, honest.
[MRS. BRILL] All right. I will give you one task and one task only. And, so help me, if you get this
[MRS. BRILL] wrong I'll swing for you and sing as they pull the lever!
[STAGE] (filled with a sense of the task's importance)
[ROBERTSON AY] What is it, Mrs. Brill?
[MRS. BRILL] Put the icing tools next to the cake, and I'll need a bowl of hot water to warm them.
[MRS. BRILL] I will make the icing as soon as I'm back.
[STAGE] (simultaneously committing the tasks to memory)
[ROBERTSON AY] Icing tools ... cake ... hot water... I will make the icing as soon as I'm back. ..
[MRS. BRILL] Now, do you think you can manage that?
[ROBERTSON AY] Is that all?
[MRS. BRILL] For you, yes. For me, no. Once the cake's done, I've the sandwiches next because
[MRS. BRILL] Madam wants them fresh. So I can't start them until there's no time to finish them.
[MRS. BRILL] I swear, a slave in ancient Rome was on a pleasure cruise compared to my life in this
[MRS. BRILL] house!
[STAGE] (MRS. BRILL storms out and slams the door behind her.)
[JANE] Well, don't just stand there, Robertson Ay.
[ROBERTSON AY] Right. .. no ...
[STAGE] (ROBERTSON A Y looks around.)
[JANE] What are you looking for?
[ROBERTSON AY] A bowl. For the water.
[STAGE] (ROBERTSON AY goes to the kitchen dresser. JANE has an idea.)
[JANE] Michael, why don't we make the icing?
[MICHAEL] Because we don't know how?
[JANE] Don't be so feeble. Get the eggs. If Mrs. Brill can do it, it can't be that hard.
[MICHAEL] Are there eggs in icing?
[JANE] There are in mine.
[JANE] (JANE starts to mix the sugar and water as MICHAEL finds the eggs. ROBERTSON
[JANE] A Y carries the icing stuff to the table.)
[ROBERTSON AY] I don't think Mrs. Brill will thank you-
[JANE] Then she will be guilty of great ingratitude.
[STAGE] (MICHAEL and ROBERTSON A Y look at Jane's mix.)
[MICHAEL] Is it supposed to look like this?
[ROBERTSON AY] It doesn't look like that when Mrs. Brill does it.
[JANE] Don't be impertinent and get me the cake!
[STAGE] (ROBERTSON AY goes to the sink to fetch some water.)
[ROBERTSON AY] Honestly, Miss Jane, I was only trying to be helpfuL If you would-
[ROBERTSON AY] (ROBERTSON A Y burns his hand on the faucet and is thrown back by force.
[ROBERTSON AY] Ricocheting across the room, he destroys the entire kitchen and ends up in an
[ROBERTSON AY] unconscious heap.)
[JANE, MICHAEL] Yeah!
[WINIFRED (0.5.)] Mrs. Brill, go up and get ready now-
[WINIFRED (0.5.)] (WINIFRED appears in the doorway and breaks off, stunned.) -35 -
[STAGE] (to JANE and MICHAEL)
[WINIFRED] What have you done! Robertson Ay! Robertson Ay! Oh dear, should I call a doctor?
[STAGE] (entering, as if on cue)
[MARY POPPINS] I don't think that will be necessary, ma'am.
[STAGE] (to JANE and MICHAEL)
[WINIFRED] How can you be so unkind, when you know how important my party is? You
[WINIFRED] deserve some very nasty medicine! Just you wait 'til bedtime!
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS enters and removes a medicine bottle and spoon from a cabinet.)
[MARY POPPINS] Oh, I don't think we should wait 'til then, ma'am. Why not go up and get changed?
[STAGE] (to the CHILDREN)
[MARY POPPINS] We'll clear up, won't we?
[STAGE] (WINIFRED exits the kitchen.)
[MICHAEL] But we're not ill! I won't take it, and you can't make me!
[MARY POPPINS] In that, as in so many things, your information is faulty. Open.
[MARY POPPINS] (MARY POPPINS pours a spoonful of liquid into MICHAEL's mouth. He runs his
[MARY POPPINS] tongue round his lips.)
[MARY POPPINS] B . , be I ut... It s straw rry Ice.
[MARY POPPINS] Now you. MICHAEL
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS walks towards JANE, who whispers anxiously.)
[JANE] I'm not sure I like strawberry ice.
[MARY POPPINS] I'm not sure I care. Open.
[STAGE] (JANE does, screwing up her face. She is similarly surprised.)
[JANE] Lime Cordial!
[MARY POPPINS] Now, off we go, you two. Michael, I know you like to keep things neat. Jane ...
[MICHAEL] I told you she was tricky.
[JANE] Must we? Can't Robertson Ay do it when he wakes up? He is a servant.
[MARY POPPINS] With that attitude, you'll get through a lot of staff before you're very old. Besides ...

[CHAIRMAN] I see Herr Von Hussler is coming in again today. Have you made your decision?

[TARGETS ARE MET...] (In his office, GEORGE , with some papers before him, is in conversation with HERR
[VON HUSSLER] Herr Banks, what objections can you have? My security is more than adequate and
[VON HUSSLER] Latin America is an expanding market. What is the matter? Have you no courage?
[GEORGE] But Mr. Von Hussler, what I haven't been able to grasp is: what exactly is your final
[GEORGE] product?
[VON HUSSLER] What do you think? Money, of course!
[GEORGE] Yes, money. But I wonder, making money out of money, is that enough?
[VON HUSSLER] Are you man enough to be a banker?

[BUSINESS IS BRISK. ..] honest Northerner who presents his argument for a bank loan.)
[NORTHBROOK] Have you corne to your decision, Mr. Banks? There's a town of good people whose
[NORTHBROOK] future depends on you.
[GEORGE] I know that...
[NORTHBROOK] Give us this chance. You won't regret it. The factory could be running in weeks and
[NORTHBROOK] expanding before the year's out. Please, Mr. Banks. 1'd give it everything I've got,
[NORTHBROOK] believe me.
[GEORGE] I do believe you, Mr. Northbrook, and I've tried to find a way, but there just is not
[GEORGE] the collateral.
[NORTHBROOK] What about my workforce? Decent men who want a better life -they're my
[NORTHBROOK] collateral!

[GEORGE] I'm sorry, Mr. Northbrook , but 1...
[STAGE] (The CHILDREN burst in. MARY POPPINS follows. GEORGE is startled.)
[JANE, MICHAEL] Hello, Daddy.
[GEORGE] What on earth are you doing here? Can't you see I'm busy?
[NORTHBROOK] No. We're done, and no man should be too busy for his own children.
[STAGE] (to MICHAEL)
[NORTHBROOK] What are you here for young man? Have you come for some money as well?
[GEORGE] Hardly. What would they need money for?
[NORTHBROOK] Well, it's never too early to learn its value ...
[STAGE] (NORTHBROOK pulls two coins out and hands them to the children.)
[MICHAEL] I know the value of this: sixpence.
[NORTHBROOK] No, that's its worth. Its value's in how you spend it. Do good, and may you have
[NORTHBROOK] good luck.
[MARY POPPINS] And what do you say to Mr. Northbrook?
[JANE, MICHAEL] Thank you!
[NORTHBROOK] I'll wait outside.
[STAGE] (With a smile for the children, NORTHBROOK exits.)
[GEORGE] What is the meaning of this? Really, Mary Poppins, I am not without a sense of
[GEORGE] humor-
[MICHAEL] Aren't you, Daddy?
[~] [MICHAEL] MARY POPPI NS -45 -
[GEORGE] No, I am not! But when I was a little boy, I would never have dared interrupt my father.
[MICHAEL] Were you ever a little boy?
[GEORGE] Of course I was, but my nanny, Miss Andrew, kept me out of my father's way, and
[GEORGE] he'd have been very annoyed if she hadn't.
[JANE] What about your mother?
[GEORGE] I shouldn't think I saw either of them more than once a week.
[JANE] Didn't they mind?
[GEORGE] Mind? They were glad to be rid of me!
[MICHAEL] Then who kissed you goodnight? Miss Andrew?
[STAGE] (this horrible image almost overpowering him)
[GEORGE] Certainly not! There was no time for hugs and kisses and all that soppy nonsense.
[STAGE] (notices that the CHILDREN are aghast)
[GEORGE] What' 5 the matter?
[MICHAEL] Poor Daddy.
[GEORGE] "Poor"? What do you mean "poor"? That's what made me the man I am! Eh, Mary
[GEORGE] Poppins?
[MARY POPPINS] Yes, I'm afraid it did.

[STAGE] (GEORGE is not sure he can have heard this correctly.)
[GEORGE] That's enough. You've seen where I work, and I have a great deal to do.
[JANE] When you invest the bank's money, what are you looking for, Daddy? A good man
[JANE] or a good idea?
[GEORGE] I suppose I should say it's a good idea, but a good man is much rarer, and much
[GEORGE] more valuable.
[MARY POPPINS] Come along, children.
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS exits with JANE and NIICHAEL.)
[GEORGE] Mr. Von Hussler, I've considered your arguments, but I'm afraid my answer is no.
[VON HUSSLER] So you don't recognize a good idea?
[GEORGE] Perhaps not, but I recognize a good man when I see one.
[VON HUSSLER] You will regret this, Herr Banks.
[STAGE] (VON HUSSLER leaves in a huff. GEORGE watches him go, thinking aloud.)
[~] [GEORGE] A MAN WITH DREAMS THAT LIFE HASN'T BROKEN,
[~] [GEORGE] A MAN WITH HOPES, AMBITIONS TO FULFILL ,
[~] [GEORGE] A MAN YOU'RE CERTAIN AT FIRST GLANCE
[STAGE] (GEORGE turns to find NORTHBROOK back in his office.)
[DESERVES A CHANCE ...] Now, Mr. Northbrook, when exactly could the factory open?

[JANE] Isn't that Miss Lark's dog, Willoughby?
[MARY POPPINS] Don't interrupt when someone's barking.
[STAGE] (to WILLOUGHBY)
[MARY POPPINS] You were saying?
[STAGE] (WILLOUGHBY barks again. MARY POPPINS answers in an acid tone.)
[MARY POPPINS] Really? Welt if she keeps wandering oft perhaps it would be better if you kept her
[MARY POPPINS] on a lead.

[MARY POPPINS] Willoughby!
[MARY POPPINS] Ah look, here she comes now. MISS LARK
[MISS LARK] Willoughby! It's all right. Mummy's here!
[STAGE] (MISS LARK hurries to WILLOUGHBY, who barks eagerly as she scoops him up.)
[MISS LARK] You know, sometimes you'd almost think he could talk.
[STAGE] (WILLOUGHBY barks. Smothering the dog with kisses, MISS LARK rushes off)
[JANE] Bert, can Willoughby really talk?
[BERT] Of course he can. Getting him to stop is the problem .
[STAGE] (to MARY POPPINS)
[MICHAEL] How do you learn to talk dog?
[MARY POPPINS] How do you think? Master the gramrnar-
[BERT] Practice when you can-
[MARY POPPINS] And avoid mongrels.
[MARY POPPINS, BERT] Far too much slang.
[MARY POPPINS] Now, come along. I can't stand here all day talking shop.
[MICHAEL] "Talking shop"? What a silly expression.
[MARY POPPINS] There's nothing silly about it in the least.
[JANE] What do you buy in a talking shop?
[MARY POPPINS] Conversations, of course.
[JANE] Well, I've never seen a talking shop.
[MARY POPPINS] Well, there is only one, and it belongs to Mrs. Corry.
[MICHAEL] Who's Mrs. Corry?
[BERT] "Who's Mrs. Corry?" Mrs. Corry is older than anyone in the world. She talked to
[BERT] William before he went conquering, to Vlad before he went impaling, and to
[BERT] Alexander when he weren't so great.
[MARY POPPINS] We'll have to call at her shop in the park.
[JANE] There is no shop in the park.
[MARY POPPINS] Remember, anything can happen if you let it.
[MARY POPPINS] (Mrs. Corry's Shop magically appears behind them. MRS. CORRY and her two
[MARY POPPINS] daughters , ANNIE and FANNIE, are surrounded by clamoring CUSTOMERS
[MARY POPPINS] demanding to buy conversations. But as they shout, their conversation starts to dribble
[MARY POPPINS] into silence.)
[MRS. CORRY] That's it! I've run out of conversations!
[STAGE] (MRS. CORRY turns from the CUSTOMERS and sees JANE and MICHAEL.)
[MARY POPPINS] Good day to you, Mrs. Corry.
[MRS. CORRY] Welt well, well ... if it isn't Mary Poppins! With Jane and Michael Banks!
[MICHAEL] She knows us?
[MRS. CORRY] And how is poor little Georgie?
[MICHAEL] Who?
[MRS. CORRY] Georgie Banks. Your father. He used to give his nanny the slip and come into my
[MRS. CORRY] shop here in secret.
[MICHAEL] But it can't have been the same George Banks! It would be forty years ago, and no
[MICHAEL] one can remember back that far!
[MRS. CORRY] Listen, dearie, I remember everything! I remember Georgie used to love my
[MRS. CORRY] gingerbread . I wonder if we've got any left today? Annie! Fannie! Look lively!
[ANNIE, FANNIE] Yes, Mother!
[ANNIE, FANNIE] (MRS. CORRY hands JANE and MICHAEL a piece of her gingerbread , each one
[ANNIE, FANNIE] covered with little gold stars.)
[MRS. CORRY] There you are. Gingerbread pieces with gingerbread stars.

[MRS. CORRY] I'm out of conversations, and I'm right out of words, too. You see, I've had a lot of
[MRS. CORRY] chatterboxes in here today ... but let me see what we have left.
[STAGE] (rummages in one of her counters and pulls out a jar)
[MRS. CORRY] Ooooh, I do have some letters -and a little bit of backchat.

[MARY POPPINS] Your turn, Michael. Seven more.
[MICHAEL] A, F, 5, E, T, 0, and P.

[MARY POPPINS] Now, what words can we make?
[JANE] Welt I see "Dog" and "Cat."
[MRS. CORRY] "Rautoplex. " That's nine.
[BERT] "Lapitoferus ." That's eleven. Nearly there.
[JANE] Those don't count. You made them up!
[MRS. CORRY] And where do you think words came from in the first place? Somebody had to
[MRS. CORRY] make them up.

[WINIFRED] George? What's happened? Are you ill?
[GEORGE] No. Should I be?
[WINIFRED] Of course not. Only ... why on earth are you home so early? Is everything all right?
[GEORGE] No, everything's all wrong.
[WINIFRED] My dear, what is it?
[GEORGE -59 -] If you must know, I refused some German chap a loan. It seems he went to our chief
[GEORGE -59 -] rivals. They gave him the money and now it's turned into a gold mine.
[WINIFRED] Well, they can't expect you to get it right every time.

[GEORGE] GEORGE has seen the maneuver and shouts.)
[GEORGE] Will you give it to me!
[GEORGE] (With a roar of fury, he spins MICHAEL around and roughly snatches the case away.
[GEORGE] ALL are shocked by the violence and intensity of his anger. He turns on WINIFRED.)
[GEORGE] Must I put up with this behavior? You're their mother! Why can't you do
[GEORGE] something!
[STAGE] (attempting to take control of the situation)
[WINIFRED] Well, I can try not shouting for a start.
[GEORGE] Mary Poppins! You are here to teach the children manners, and just look at them!
[GEORGE] They're a pair of little savages! If I had my way, you'd be out of this house by-
[WINIFRED] George! You're tired.
[STAGE] (GEORGE retires to the study, dejected, and closes the door.)
[WINIFRED] Mary Poppins, don't bring the children down tonight. Mr. Banks is quite exhausted.
[WINIFRED] Perhaps you could keep them occupied.
[MARY POPPINS] I hope you haven't forgotten, ma'am, tonight's my evening out.
[JANE] What?
[WINIFRED] Oh dear, I had forgotten. I suppose the best people wouldn't ask you to change your
[WINIFRED] plans?
[MARY POPPINS] No ma'am, they wouldn't.
[WINIFRED] I thought not.
[JANE] That's not fair! Daddy loses his temper and we're shut up in the nursery! Daddy's
[JANE] mean and rotten and I hate him!
[WINIFRED] Jane! Take that back this instant! I will not have you criticize your father.
[MICHAEL] Why not? He criticizes you! Last week he said you were neither use nor ornament.
[WINIFRED] How dare you-
[MICHAEL] I heard him say it and so did you!
[STAGE] (This one is below the belt. WINIFRED answers with some dignity.)
[WINIFRED] Sometimes people say things they don't mean. Take the children upstairs please,
[WINIFRED] Mary Poppins.
[WINIFRED] (JANE and MICHAEL follow the nanny up. WINIFRED goes to the study door. She
[WINIFRED] hesitates, then opens it and enters.)
[WINIFRED] George?
[GEORGE] What is it now?
[WINIFRED] I thought you might like to talk about it.
[GEORGE] What would be the point?
[WINIFRED] Perhaps I can help.
[GEORGE] Don't be ridiculous.
[WINIFRED] I'm serious, George. If you have troubles, 1'd like to share them. -61 -
[GEORGE] Don't worry. You will.

[JANE] It's not fair! You're going out, and we get left on our own!
[MARY POPPINS] You've plenty of toys to play with.
[JANE] I don't want to. They're boring!
[MARY POPPINS] They might say the same about you.
[MICHAEL] Why does Daddy get so cross?
[JANE] Fathers are supposed to look after their children, not yell at them all the time.
[MARY POPPINS] Maybe, but have you asked yourself who looks after the fathers when things go
[MARY POPPINS] wrong?
[MICHAEL] The mothers, I suppose.
[MARY POPPINS] N at the children?
[JANE] Wouldn't that be rather upside-down?
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS continues to primp herself ready for her" evening out. ")
[MARY POPPINS] Sometimes families are upside-down , for a while anyway.
[JANE] I don't want to be in an upside-down family. I wish I could run away.
[MICHAEL] Why don't you? Somebody might adopt you.
[JANE] But you'd miss me.
[MICHAEL] No, I wouldn't. I could have your toys. -63 -
[JANE] No, you could not!
[MICHAEL] Yes, I could, and I jolly well would!
[STAGE] (MICHAEL grabs the doll called VALENTINE.)
[JANE] Give that to me!
[JANE] (JANE seizes one arm of the toy while MICHAEL pulls the other, tearing
[JANE] VALENTINE's arm in the process.)
[JANE] Now look what you've done!
[STAGE] (turns to the CHILDREN)
[MARY POPPINS] That's no way to treat Valentine. What's he ever done to you?
[MICHAEL] He's a doll, silly! He couldn't do anything.
[MARY POPPINS] That's all, you two. Now, into bed. At once.
[JANE] But we haven't had our milk-
[MARY POPPINS] There'll be no buts. And no milk, either. If you can't be good, you may as well be
[MARY POPPINS] sorry.
[JANE] I wish you'd just leave us alone!
[MARY POPPINS] Be careful of the things you wish for. Poor Valentine. Go inside and make yourself
[MARY POPPINS] presentable.

[STAGE] (VALENTINE emerges from the dollhouse, naw human-scale.)
[VALENTINE] Much better, thank you.
[~] [TEMPERS ARE LOST.] NOBODY STOPS TO THINK OF THE COST.
[VALENTINE] But they tore my arm ... again!
[MARY POPPINS] Oh dear, children who lose their temper will lose everything else in the end.

[MARY POPPINS] (MARY POPPINS snaps her fingers once more, and JANE and MICHAEL sit up in
[MARY POPPINS] bed at once, staring.)
[JANE] What's going on? What's happened to the toys?
[MICHAEL] Make them go small and get back in their box!
[MARY POPPINS] Why? You've hurt them and called them names. Now it's their turn.
[~] [NOW IS THE TIME] TO TELL OF YOUR WOES,
[~] [NOW IS THE TIME] TO TELL OF THEIR CRIME.

[WINIFRED] table.)
[MISS ANDREW] It was thoroughly unpleasant. I never enjoy traveL You must be poor George's wife.
[MISS ANDREW] Your flowerbeds are disgracefully untidy! Take my advice: plant evergreens . Or
[MISS ANDREW] better still, have nothing there at all, just a plain cement courtyard.
[WINIFRED] But dear Miss Andrew, I am so fond of flowers.
[MISS ANDREW] Then you are a very silly woman. Where did George go?
[WINIFRED] He ...

[MISS ANDREW] sets her birdcage down in its place. WINIFRED passes the plant to MRS. BRILL.

[WINIFRED] We like it.
[MISS ANDREW] Then it doesn't take a lot to keep you happy. Look at the dust! There! And there!

[PARK KEEPER] Oh, a kite is it? My word, it is. I haven't flown a kite since I was a boy.

[JANE] It's been so awful since you went away and now Miss Andrew's come and Daddy's
[JANE] ruined and we never helped him like you wanted us to and we were too stupid to
[JANE] hear what you were saying-
[MARY POPPINS] Oh, my eye, but your life's a tragedy. Now let's go home. And don't dawdle.
[MICHAEL] But she's there. She came this morning. As a surprise for Daddy.
[MARY POPPINS] Did she?
[STAGE] (very firm)
[MARY POPPINS] Well, maybe I'll be a surprise for her.
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS)
[STAGE] (warmly)
[MARY POPPINS] That was a lovely greeting, Bert.
[BERT] I meant it, Mary ... welcome . You're a sight for sore eyes.
[JANE] You really are. Welcome back, Mary Poppins.
[STAGE] (winks at MARY POPPINS)
[BERT] I told you they were good kids, Mary.
[MARY POPPINS] And I told you they were worth bothering with.
[MARY POPPINS] (The PARK KEEPER has now recovered from his initial shock and for a brave moment
[MARY POPPINS] he tries to block MARY POPPINS 's way.)
[PARK KEEPER] Now see here! It's against the regulations! Coming down from the sky like that!
[PARK KEEPER] And where from, I'd like to know, ei? Where from?
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS stops and eyes the PARK KEEPER coldly.)
[MARY POPPINS] If I were a Park Keeper, I should straighten my cap and button my coat!
[STAGE] (The PARK KEEPER is speechless.)
[MARY POPPINS] Come along, children.
[MICHAEL] Aren't you going to shake hands with Bert for luck?
[MARY POPPINS] No.
[MICHAEL] Why not? We have.
[MARY POPPINS] 1 don't need any luck, thank you.
[MARY POPPINS] (MARY POPPINS exits with the children. The PARK KEEPER reaches for the kite,
[MARY POPPINS] but then backs off as BERT moves to pick it up. With a wink, BERT signals that the
[MARY POPPINS] PARK KEEPER can keep it. What glee!) -83 -
[HEADER] SCENE 3: GOOD FOR NOTHING -Park
[STAGE] (Evening falls, and the scene changes to another part of the park with trees and a bench.
[STAGE] Young KITE FLYERS run through the trees on their way home, and BERT enters with
[STAGE] a lamplighter's taper. GEORGE wanders in alone and slumps wearily onto the bench.)

[HEADER] SCENE 4: WINIFRED DESPAIRS -Park
[STAGE] (WINIFRED and the POLICEMAN enter the park. She's nearly out of her wits.)
[POLICEMAN] They'll find their way home in no time. Let's face it, ma'am, they've had enough
[POLICEMAN] practice.
[WINIFRED] But this time they're not being naughty. I'm afraid I've made them unhappy. I'm
[WINIFRED] afraid I've made everyone unhappy ...
[POLICEMAN] They'll tum up. Don't you worry.
[STAGE] (The POLICEMAN goes to look for Jane and Michael.)
[~] [GEORGE, DEAR,] I KNOW IT HURTS YOUR PRIDE, DEAR.

[STAGE] CHILDREN. They stand and listen.) -87 -
[SONG] #18 -BrimstoTle al/d Treacle (Part 2) Mary Poppins/ Miss Andrew
[MICHAEL] Perhaps she's killed everyone. Perhaps they're all dead.
[MICHAEL] (There is a harsh shout from above. MISS ANDREW is issuing instructions to
[STAGE] (offstage)
[MISS ANDREW] Not like that/ you stupid boy!
[JANE] Well, they're not all dead.
[STAGE] (A tiny sound, partly a sigh and partly a whistle emanates from the covered cage.)
[JANE] 'What's that noise?
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS strides over to the covered cage.)
[MARY POPPINS] If s a bird. I might have known!
[MARY POPPINS] (With a sudden flourish, MARY POPPINS removes the cover to reveal the bird within.
[MARY POPPINS] With a start of recognition, Caruso opens his beak and gives a sad, little cheep. MARY
[MARY POPPINS] POPPINS answers him in song.)
[~] [DID SHE?] WELL, FRANKLY THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE.

[~] [AN HOUR, NO LONGER,] ONCE YOU ARE FREE FROM THIS CELL
[MICHAEL] What kind of bird is it?
[MARY POPPINS] A lark. You are seeing a lark in a cage for the first time -and the last!
[MARY POPPINS] (MARY POPPINS opens the door of the cage and carefully carries Caruso to the
[MARY POPPINS] window, out of which he flies away then chirps back thanks.)
[MARY POPPINS] My pleasure.
[STAGE] (Another chirp.)
[MARY POPPINS] Oh, don't mention it.
[STAGE] (from upstairs in a booming voice)
[MISS ANDREW] I am going downstairs to fetch Caruso, my lark.
[STAGE] (appears and calls back to ROBERTSON AY)
[MISS ANDREW] You stay there and clean the grate again!
[MISS ANDREW] (MARY POPPINS replaces the cover over the empty birdcage as MISS ANDREW
[MISS ANDREW] starts down the stairs and spies the CHILDREN . MARY POPPINS is out of her
[MISS ANDREW] view.)
[MISS ANDREW] So you've decided to come crawling back, have you? Well, I think we know what's
[MISS ANDREW] needed now!
[STAGE] (searching the room)
[~] [MISS ANDREW] BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE, MY FAVORITE LIQUOR

[~] [MISS ANDREW] IMPUDENT CHILDREN RESPOND SO MUCH QUICKER
[~] [MISS ANDREW] WHEN FORCED TO DRINK EVERY LAST DROP.
[MISS ANDREW] (During this MISS ANDREW looks for but cannot find the brimstone and treacle.
[MISS ANDREW] MARY POPPINS steps out of the shadows, holding out the offending bottle.)
[MARY POPPINS] Is this what you're looking for?
[STAGE] (explodes)
[MARY POPPINS] Who are you? MISS ANDREW
[MARY POPPINS] 1'm Mary Poppins.
[MISS ANDREW] Mary Poppins? But you left without notice!
[MARY POPPINS] And I've come back without notice.
[MISS ANDREW] I see. And what do you expect me to do?
[MARY POPPINS] Pack.
[MISS ANDREW] Pack! You insolent young person! How dare you speak to me in this way?
[STAGE] (MISS ANDREW grabs the bottle and squares offwith MARY POPPINS.)

[~] [MISS ANDREW] I BRING UP CHILDREN SO THEY KNOW THEIR PLACE.
[~] [MISS ANDREW] STANDING FOR TRADITION I GOVERN MY CHARGES.

[~] [MISS ANDREW] A SHINING EXAMPLE, A PILLAR.
[~] [A POST!] THEY ALL HAVE THEIR PROBLEMS, BUT HIM MORE THAN MOST.
[A POST!] (JANE and MICHAEL laugh at how MARY POPPINS is putting MISS ANDREW to
[A POST!] shame. MISS ANDREW goes to the birdcage to find Caruso missing.) -89 -
[MISS ANDREW] Caruso! Where is my lark? Caruso!
[MISS ANDREW] (Caruso tweets outside. MISS ANDREW looks through the window, lets out a gasp,
[MISS ANDREW] turns on the CHILDREN and brandishes her bottle.)
[~] [MISS ANDREW] YOU LET MY LITTLE LARK OUT OF HIS CAGE.
[~] [MISS ANDREW] NOW YOU WILL BEAR THE FULL BRUNT OF MY RAGE.

[STAGE] (. .. WINIFRED, having heard Mary Poppins's voice, enters.)
[WINIFRED] Mary Poppins! Wherever did you come from?
[MICHAEL] She came from up-
[MARY POPPINS] Michael!
[WINIFRED] Michael? Jane? Is that you? Oh, thank heaven! But you're very naughty to go
[WINIFRED] running off like that and I should be as angry as anything ... if I weren't so pleased to
[WINIFRED] see you!
[STAGE] (hugs the CHILDREN close)
[WINIFRED] Where's Miss Andrew?
[MARY POPPINS] She's gone.
[WINIFRED] Gone? Why?
[MARY POPPINS] She didn't give a reason, ma'am.
[WINIFRED] How peculiar! So, Mary Poppins, if you're back, are you going to stay?
[MARY POPPINS] I'll stay for as long as necessary, rna' am.
[STAGE] (This isn't quite the response WINIFRED was hoping for.)
[WINIFRED] Because the last time you were here, you left without a word of warning . How do I
[WINIFRED] know you won't do it again?
[MARY POPPINS] You don't.
[WINIFRED] Oh.
[STAGE] (MRS. BRILL appears with the POLICEMAN in tow.)
[MRS. BRILL] Excuse me, rna' am ...
[WINIFRED] Constable, I'm so sorry I bothered you, but it's quite all right. They're back and-
[POLICEMAN] Not all of them, rna' am.
[WINIFRED] What?
[POLICEMAN] We found this one a-wandering in the park.
[STAGE] (steps to one side, revealing GEORGE)
[POLICEMAN] C'night, ma'am.
[STAGE] (The POLICEMAN tips his helmet and goes. GEORGE steps into the parlor.)
[WINIFRED] George.
[GEORGE] Where is she?
[WINIFRED] Miss Andrew? She left.
[GEORGE] Left? But how?
[STAGE] (With a look to MAR Y POPPINS, JANE explains.)
[JANE] She might have thought we were rude.
[GEORGE] Rude? To Miss Andrew? Well, I can't forgive it, but I'll try to forget. In fact-
[STAGE] (fumbles in his pockets with no result)
[GEORGE] 1'd have given you sixpence if I had one.
[STAGE] (This deflates GEORGE again. WINIFRED intervenes.)
[WINIFRED] George, you haven't noticed. Mary Poppins is back.
[GEORGE] Is she? Mary Poppins. Well, well. I wonder if 1... -93 -
[-94 - MARY POPPINS] (MARY POPPINS quickly and gracefully descends the stairs and crosses into the
[-94 - MARY POPPINS] study.)
[STAGE] (GEORGE)
[-94 - MARY POPPINS] ... might have a word?
[STAGE] (follows MARY POPPINS into the study, shuts the door, and clears his throat)
[-94 - MARY POPPINS] There's no point in beating about the bush. Things have not gone well for us since
[-94 - MARY POPPINS] you left us and-
[MARY POPPINS] About my wages, sir. If you don't mind, I won't take any just now. I should prefer
[MARY POPPINS] to let them accrue.
[GEORGE] But Mary Poppins, if you only knew how many payments are accruing as it is!
[GEORGE] (Before GEORGE says more, MARY POPPINS nods and leaves the study.
[GEORGE] 'VVINIFRED is waiting outside.)
[WINIFRED] Is everything settled?
[MARY POPPINS] It is. Now, I must get started. Jane, Michael, spit-spot.
[SONG] #18/\ -Practically Perfect (Reprise) Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS goes up stairs with JANE and MICHAEL. She halts for a moment,
[STAGE] sniffing the air.)
[STAGE] Are the drains playing up, or is Mrs. Brill cooking?
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS continues her ascent. Below, 'VVINIFRED looks at her GEORGE .
[STAGE] She goes to comfort him, stroking his hair. He starts to speak but can't.)
[WINIFRED] Come along, darling. You made a wrong decision, but how bad is that? After so
[WINIFRED] many years of good service? What's the worst that can happen?
[STAGE] (thinks for a moment)
[GEORGE] Winifred ... if I am to be dismissed by the bank, we'll be destitute. The servants will
[GEORGE] leave, the house will be repossessed, and we'll be outside with the children sitting on
[GEORGE] the frosty curbside.
[STAGE] (This is a blow to 'VVINIFRED , but after a second, she recovers.)
[WINIFRED] We'll still have what really matters.
[STAGE] (GEORGE looks at WINIFRED, bevJildered . She smiles.)
[WINIFRED] The children. And each other. -95 -
[STAGE] (Against GEORGE's expectations, WINIFRED has comforted him. They exit together.)

[JANE] Is that locket new?
[MARY POPPINS] And if it is?
[JANE] What's inside it?
[MARY POPPINS] A portrait.
[MICHAEL] Whose?
[MARY POPPINS] You'll know when the time comes and not before.
[MICHAEL] You are going to stay this time, aren't you?
[STAGE] (thinks for a second, fingering the locket)
[MARY POPPINS] I'll stay' til the chain breaks.
[MICHAEL] What chain? Where?
[STAGE] (MICHAEL looks to JANE, but she can only shrug. The lights pulse.)
[MARY POPPINS] Michael, you must be careful. The room's a bit excited to see me back. And you
[MARY POPPINS] never know what might happen around a fireplace.
[MARY POPPINS] (Suddenly MICHAEL is gripped by an invisible force and dragged towards the fireplace
[MARY POPPINS] and whisked up the chimney.)
[JANE] Michael! Michael! Come down!

[MARY POPPINS] That's better.
[MICHAEL] The world is awfully big, isn't it?
[MARY POPPINS] And what does that tell you?

[MARY POPPINS] open front door, carrying the MESSENGER with them. They greet GEORGE
[MARY POPPINS] variously as they pass.)
[STAGE] (SWEEPS)
[MARY POPPINS] Good night, Guv'nor. Cheerio, Guv'nor. C'night, Guv'nor.
[STAGE] (disguised as a SWEEP)
[MARY POPPINS] Cheerio, Guv'nor. MICHAEL
[STAGE] (But this penultimate SWEEP looks a little familiar.)
[GEORGE] Not so fast. Upstairs ... now! Jane, you too. Mary Pop pins, would you be good
[GEORGE] enough to explain?
[MARY POPPINS] First of all, I would like to make one thing clear.
[GEORGE] Yes?
[MARY POPPINS] I never explain anything. Come along, children.
[MARY POPPINS] (MARY POPPINS goes upstairs with JANE and MICHAEL.) -105 -
[HEADER] SCENE 9: A MAN HAS DREAMS -Parlor
[STAGE] (The sweeps have gone; only BERT lingers, unnoticed by the rest. GEORGE has
[STAGE] opened the letter. WINIFRED comes over. He looks up.)
[GEORGE] It's happened. The Chairman wants to see me at the close of business tonight.
[WINIFRED] Tonight! Well I'm going to come with you and jolly well give your Chairman a piece
[WINIFRED] of my mind.
[GEORGE] That would only make matters worse. We might as well face it. In just a few hours I
[GEORGE] will have joined the ranks of the unemployed.
[WINIFRED] Oh, George. Are you quite sure?
[GEORGE] Quite sure. So we'd better make some plans. In fact, I'm afraid the time has come ...
[GEORGE] (GEORGE looks up at his mother's precious vase as MRS. BRILL comes into the parlor
[GEORGE] to tidy up.)
[WINIFRED] Do you mean your mother's vase? Won't you miss it terribly?
[GEORGE] Needs must, my dear. We always said we were saving it for a rainy day, and
[GEORGE] tomorrow it looks set to pour.
[STAGE] (GEORGE climbs onto a chair and, gingerly, he picks up the vase.)
[WINIFRED] George -do be careful.
[WINIFRED] (GEORGE starts to climb down again when MRS. BRILL absentmindedly bangs into
[WINIFRED] the chair amid her cleaning. The vase slips from George's hands and shatters on the
[WINIFRED] floor. MRS. BRILL is aghast.)
[MRS. BRILL] Ah! The heirloom!
[MRS. BRILL] (Pulling out a huge handkerchief MRS. BRILL starts to blub uncontrollably. This is
[MRS. BRILL] not helping the stunned GEORGE.)
[WINIFRED] Mrs. Brill/let's go to the kitchen, shall we? You'd better sit down ...
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS appears on the landing and sniffs the air.)
[MARY POPPINS] Mrs. Brill, is that the dirmer cooking?
[STAGE] (lifts her face from her handkerchief)
[MRS. BRILL] Don't you start. I've opened all the windows-
[MARY POPPINS] I was only going to say that it smells ... delicious!
[STAGE] (MARY POPPINS heads up the stairs.)
[MRS. BRILL] The whole world has gone upside-down!
[STAGE] (MRS. BRILL exits with renewed anguish, followed by WINIFRED.)

[MRS. BRILL] CClHgC, Bert
[MRS. BRILL] (GEORGE is alone when he sees a smattering of shining stars among the broken pieces.
[MRS. BRILL] He bends down to pick them up.)
[GEORGE] Well, I never. So that's where I put them.
[BERT] What are they?
[STAGE] (To GEORGE's surprise, BERT has emerged from the shadows.)
[GEORGE] Stars. Gingerbread stars I hid once from my nanny. I always knew I'd put them
[GEORGE] somewhere no one would find them. Trouble was I couldn't find them either.
[BERT] They're very bright.
[GEORGE] Aren't they? Even after all this time.
[BERT] Here, let me give you a hand.
[STAGE] (BERT helps to pick up the pieces of the vase.)
[GEORGE] I used to dream that when I grew up I'd learn everything there was to know about
[GEORGE] the stars.
[STAGE] (thoughtful pause)
[GEORGE] Funny. I haven't thought about all that in years. I'm not usually sentimental.
[BERT] S' good to look back sometimes.
[GEORGE] Is it? I'm not so sure.
[~] [GEORGE] A MAN HAS DREAMS OF WALKING WITH GIANTS,
[~] [GEORGE] TO CARVE HIS NICHE IN THE EDIFICE OF TIME.
[~] [GEORGE] BEFORE THE MORTAR OF HIS ZEAL
[~] [GEORGE] HAS THE CHANCE TO CONGEAL,
[GEORGE] The cup is dashed from his lips.
[GEORGE] The flame is snuffed aborning.
[GEORGE] He's brought to rack and ruin in his prime!
[BERT] Life's a rum go, Guv'nor, and that's the truth.
[GEORGE] You know what I think? It's Mary Poppins! From the moment she stepped into the
[GEORGE] house, things began to happen to me!
[~] [GEORGE] MY WORLD WAS CALM, WELL ORDERED, EXEMPLARY.
[~] [GEORGE] THEN CAME THIS PERSON WITH CHAOS IN HER WAKE,
[~] [GEORGE] AND NOW MY LIFE'S AMBITIONS GO WITH ONE FELL BLOW.
[~] [GEORGE] IT'S QUITE A BITTER PILL TO TAKE.
[GEORGE] It's that Pop pins woman! She's responsible for all this!
[BERT] I know the very person. What's that thing she's always saying?
[~] [BERT] A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR, THAT IS ALL IT TAKES.
[~] [BERT] IT CHANGES BREAD AND WATER INTO TEA AND CAKES.
[~] [BERT] A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR GOES A LONG, LONG WAY,
[~] [BERT] SO' AVE YOURSELF AN 'EALTHY 'ELPING EVERY DAY.
[GEORGE] A healthy helping of trouble if you ask me!
[STAGE] (GEORGE attempts to occupy himself with papers in his study.)
[BERT] Like you say, Guv'nor.
[STAGE] (placing the vase pieces carefully in the rubbish bin)
[~] [BERT] YOU'VE GOT TO GRIND, GRIND, GRIND AT THAT GRINDSTONE
[~] [BERT] THOUGH CHILDHOOD SLIPS LIKE SAND THROUGH A SIEVE.
[~] [BERT] AND ALL TOO SOON THEY'VE UP AND GROWN, -109 -
[~] [BERT] AND THEN THEY'VE FLOWN, AND IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU TO GIVE ...
[BERT] (The CHILDREN come out of the nursery and start downstairs. MARY POPPINS
[BERT] watches remains behind on the stairs. GEORGE re-enters the parlor.)
[~] [BERT] JUST THAT SPOONFUL OF SUGAR TO 'ELP THE MEDICINE GO DOWN,
[~] [BERT] THE MEDICINE GO DOWN, MEDICINE GO DOWN ...
[STAGE] (holds out his hand to GEORGE)
[BERT] Well, good luck, Guv'nor.
[BERT] (For a moment, GEORGE is still and then, deliberately, he takes the sooty paw and
[BERT] shakes it firmly.)
[GEORGE] Thank you, Bert. And good luck to you, too.
[GEORGE] (BERT pauses in the hall only to tum and look up at MARY POPPINS. She answers
[GEORGE] his look with a nod and he leaves. The CHILDREN approach their father cautiously.
[GEORGE] As they speak, MARY POPPINS comes down silently, carrying something.)
[JANE] Father ...
[GEORGE] What is it?
[MICHAEL] We've corne to say goodnight.
[GEORGE] Ah. Yes. Goodnight.
[STAGE] (But GEORGE is less severe than usual. JANE approaches.)
[JANE] Daddy, do you remember when we carne to the bank?
[GEORGE] Yes.
[JANE] Welt we were each given a sixpence, and were told to spend them carefully.
[GEORGE] Excellent advice. That's exactly what you should do. What did you buy with them?
[JANE] Nothing yet. We kept them. And now we've decided to give them to you.
[GEORGE] I suppose Mary Poppins put you up to this.
[JANE] No. She hasn't said a word about it, but we know it's been difficult for you lately
[JANE] and we haven't really been much help.
[MICHAEL] So we thought a bit of extra cash might loosen things up a little.
[JANE] It is a whole shilling.
[GEORGE] Thank you.
[GEORGE] (GEORGE cannot speak for fear of crying. He nods briskly and takes the coins in
[GEORGE] silence.)
[JANE] Goodnight, Daddy. We do love you, you knOw.
[STAGE] (JANE reaches up and kisses GEORGE.)
[GEORGE] Jane. Do you remember you once asked me who Neleus's father was?
[JANE] Yes.
[GEORGE] It was Poseidon, King of the Sea. Goodnight.

[STAGE] (The CHILDREN head up to the nursery, passing MARY POPPINS. GEORGE goes
[STAGE] into his study. MARY POPPINS swiftly places the object -Michael's broken makeshift
[STAGE] kite -on the floor of the hall, then sails upstairs. GEORGE emerges from his study and
[STAGE] sees the kite. Thoughtfully, he picks it up.)
[HEADER] SCENE 10: ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, PART 1 -Nursery
[STAGE] (WINIFRED tucks the CHILDREN into bed.)
[JANE] Mummy? Daddy's really worried, isn't he?
[WINIFRED] Yes, he is. But always remember that he loves you very much. And that's far more
[WINIFRED] important than jobs or houses or anything else.
[MICHAEL] Are you going to the bank with him?
[WINIFRED -111 -] I wish he'd let me. But he won't. If only there was someone to speak up for him. To
[WINIFRED -111 -] take his part. To show them what he's really like inside.
[JANE] Why can't he do that for himself?
[WINIFRED] Because he's a man. And a very proud one.
[MICHAEL] Then you must go!
[WINIFRED] 1'd like to go, but I'm afraid it just isn't possible.
[MICHAEL] Why?
[STAGE] (smiles)
[WINIFRED] Because 1'm a woman.
[STAGE] (There's a pause. MARY POPPINS enters.)
[JANE] Mary Pop pins says anything is possible if we can only get out of our own way.

[MARY POPPINS] nursery and fly over the rooftops of London.)
[HEADER] SCENE 11: ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, PART 2 -
[STAGE] Cathedral Steps, Bank
[STAGE] (On a street near the steps of St. Paul's Cathdral, MARY POPPINS and the
[STAGE] CHILDREN become spectators, unseen by the others. Snow starts to fall. The BIRD
[STAGE] WOMAN scatters corn for the pigeons. GEORGE enters and walks until, as a
[STAGE] background to his troubled thoughts, he sees her.)
[~] [BIRD WOMAN] FEED THE BIRDS, TUPPENCE A BAG,
[~] [BIRD WOMAN] TUPPENCE, TUPPENCE, TUPPENCE A BAG.
[STAGE] (GEORGE passes the BIRD WOMAN, then he hesitates and retraces his steps.)
[BIRD WOMAN] Feed the birds, sir? Only tuppence a bag.
[STAGE] (pulls out two coins and puts them in her hand)
[GEORGE] I would take it as a great favor if you would kindly feed them for me.
[~] [BIRD WOMAN] TUPPENCE, TUPPENCE, TUPPENCE A BAG.
[BIRD WOMAN] (Leaving the BIRD WOMAN staring at the amount he has given, GEORGE walks
[BIRD WOMAN] towards the bank. For all his bravado, he is nervous now that the time has come.
[BIRD WOMAN] He shines his shoes on the backs of his trouser legs and enters the bank. The entire
[BIRD WOMAN] BOARD OF DIRECTORS is waiting inside the bank.)
[DOORMEN] Mr. Banks is here.
[CHAIRMAN] Come in, Banks.
[JOBS ON THE LINE.] (GEORGE enters. He stands there, alone. MARY POPPINS and the CHILDREN
[JOBS ON THE LINE.] observe the action, unseen.)
[CHAIRMAN] Welt Banks, how did it happen? You turned down a scheme that was bound to
[CHAIRMAN] make millions, and we want to know why.
[STAGE] (The assembled BANKERS wait. Firmly, GEORGE starts to speak.)
[GEORGE -115 -] Then I'll tell you. I refused Mr. Von Hussler because his scheme was hollow. It had
[GEORGE -115 -] no product, it had no substance, it had no meaning outside the walls of a bank! Oh
[GEORGE -115 -] yes, he told me about assets and profits and growth, but there wasn't a word about
[GEORGE -115 -] people! I know that if a man puts any value on real life, then as far as you're
[GEORGE -115 -] concerned he's a wash-out, but I'm afraid I do value it, gentlemen. In short, George
[GEORGE -115 -] Banks, Esquire, has rediscovered the human race! I apologize for ruining the bank.
[GEORGE -115 -] But I do not apologize for understanding that there are more important things in life
[GEORGE -115 -] than making money!
[GEORGE -115 -] (The silence that greets this is not one of indignation but rather of bewilderment.
[GEORGE -115 -] At last the CHAIRMAN speaks.)
[CHAIRMAN] Ruining the bank? Ruining the bank? Ruining the bank? My dear chap, what are
[CHAIRMAN] you talking about? You've saved our bacon! Haven't you heard? Von Hussler's
[CHAIRMAN] scheme has ruined our rival! You've kept us out of the nastiest scandal since records
[CHAIRMAN] began! We don't want your apologiesl We're offering ours!
[GEORGE] Ohmy word.
[CHAIRMAN] And another thing. Do you remember giving a loan to a fellow called Northbrook?
[CHAIRMAN] Well, he's repaying it and opening two new factories. With the percentage you
[CHAIRMAN] negotiated, we look set to make a fortune!
[GEORGE] Ohmy word!
[CHAIRMAN] Well, that's just it. We very much hope you might tell us how you did it. Just give
[CHAIRMAN] us the word. It'll be quite safe with us.
[STAGE] (immobile for a second, but only for a second)
[GEORGE] Give you the word? Give you the word? I'll give you the word all right:

[CHAIRMAN] (The door bursts open. WINIFRED hurtles in, running to GEORGE and guarding
[CHAIRMAN] him with her body like a lioness.)
[WINIFRED] Forgive him. It's not his fault. It's all because of his nanny, Miss Andrew!
[STAGE] (starts up, a look of sheer horror on his face)
[CHAIRMAN] The Holy Terror! She taught me everything I know!
[GEORGE] Then now's your chance to forget it!
[WINIFRED] That's right! And if you want a fight about it, then you've come to the right woman!
[STAGE] (Placing herself in front of GEORGE, WINIFRED squares up and raises her dukes.)
[GEORGE] It's all right, darling! It's all right! I haven't lost money at all! I've made the bank a
[GEORGE] fortune!
[WINIFRED] Really?
[WINIFRED] (GEORGE takes WINIFRED in his arms but can't say more before they are mobbed by
[WINIFRED] the cheering BANKERS. The CHAIRMAN claps his hands.)
[CHAIRMAN] Gentlemen.
[STAGE] (to WINIFRED , gesturing toward the door)
[CHAIRMAN] Madam, if you please, we still have some business to conduct.
[MARY POPPINS] (WINIFRED stands firmly in place. The CHAIRMAN concedes, not that he has a
[MARY POPPINS] choice in the matter.)
[STAGE] (CHAIRMAN)
[MARY POPPINS] Ah, well, Banks -George -by way of recompense, we'd like to offer you the job of
[MARY POPPINS] senior manager with a salary at double-
[WINIFRED] Exactly how much has he made for you?
[STAGE] (knows he has been admonished)
[WINIFRED] Triple-
[STAGE] (WINIFRED coughs pointedly.)
[WINIFRED] Quadruple your present rate.
[WINIFRED] (GEORGE stands agape.) CHAIRMAN
[WINIFRED] Close your mouth, George -we are not a codfish.
[CHAIRMAN] Well?
[STAGE] (looks to WINIFRED for approval)
[GEORGE] I accept, but you must understand one thing: from now on, my family comes first.
[STAGE] (looks right and left for approval)
[GEORGE] Agreed?
[STAGE] (nodding)
[GEORGE] Agreed! CHAIRMAN
[BANKERS -11 7 -] (Surrounded by a gaggle of ecstatic BANKERS, GEORGE and WINIFRED walk off

[GEORGE] Winifred, I'm afraid I've underestimated you. How can you forgive me?
[WINIFRED] How can you ask?
[GEORGE] It was selfish of me to keep you off the stage. You'll want to go back, and I won't
[GEORGE] mind if you do.
[WINIFRED] No, I loved it, but I've found a role I rather prefer, and it's going to keep me
[WINIFRED] extremely busy for a very long time ...

[JANE] Mary Poppins, Neleus and Poseidon will live happily ever after, won't they?
[MARY POPPINS] Of course.
[MICHAEL] Oh, Mary Poppins, that was the best yet! To be up in the heavens ... do you think

[MARY POPPINS] Yes. Someday.
[JANE] Really? Will it be soon?
[STAGE] (looks at them for a moment before shaking her head)
[MARY POPPINS] Oh no. Not for a very long time.

[MARY POPPINS] picks up her umbrella and carpet bag and magically exits the nursery, taking one last
[MARY POPPINS] look towards the room as the CHILDREN enter from the stairs.)
[MICHAEL] What's happened? Something's changed. The bed's gone.
[STAGE] (An object on the floor attracts JANE's attention. She stoops and picks it up.)
[JANE] Look! It's Mary Poppins's locket. Oh, the chain's broken.
[MICHAEL] Don't you remember? ''I'll stay 'til the chain breaks."
[JANE] There's a note, too.
[MICHAEL] What does it say?
[JANE] "Michael had the telescope, so this is for you."
[STAGE] (JANE opens the locket. MICHAEL looks over her shoulder.)
[JANE] It's a picture of the three of us.
[MICHAEL] She's signed it. "From Mary Poppins with a good deal of love."
[STAGE] (WINIFRED and GEORGE enter.)
[WINIFRED] Mary Poppins ... ?
[JANE] She's gone.
[WINIFRED] Gone? How peculiar.
[GEORGE] She'll be back. Now, what do you think of this?
[STAGE] (From behind his back, GEORGE produces a magnificent kite.)
[MICHAEL] It's the best I've ever seen.
[GEORGE] Could we fly it together?
[MICHAEL] Oh, Daddy!
[STAGE] (MICHAEL hugs GEORGE.)
[STAGE] (to GEORGE)
[JANE] Mary Poppins won't be comillg back. She's gone forever.

[STAGE] (smiles and gives JANE a kiss)
[JANE] They will. GEORGE
[WINIFRED] I wonder if she's right, George, and we really could do without a nanny from now
[WINIFRED] on. Vv'hat do you think?
[GEORGE] I think you'd better come and dance with me!
[WINIFRED] George, this is serious.

[WINIFRED] out the window.) -123 -
[GEORGE] Look! Wasn't that a shooting star?
[MICHAEL] You can borrow my telescope.
